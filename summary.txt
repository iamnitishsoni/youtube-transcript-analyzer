- Ayatollah Khomeini returned to Iran on February 1, 1979, after 15 years in exile, leading to the overthrow of the Shah and the establishment of an Islamic republic within two months.  
- The Iranian revolution combined a religious revival with strong anti-colonial sentiment, viewing the Shah as a US puppet, which still influences Iran-US relations today.  
- Scott Anderson's book *King of Kings* (2025) explores the revolution as a complex event marked by American miscalculations and the Shah's political errors, emphasizing its lasting impact on the Middle East and US foreign policy.  
- The Islamic regime in Iran remains stable partly due to external pressures like US and Israeli actions, which rally domestic support around the government by framing opposition as foreign-backed.  
- The Iranian revolution initiated a broader trend of religious nationalism seen globally, and the regime may leverage attacks as assaults on Islam itself to sustain its power for years to come[1][2][3][5].
