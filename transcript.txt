On February 1st, 1979,
the Ayatollah Khomeini
returned to Iran
after 15 years in exile.
Within two months,
the then reigning
Shah of Iran was overthrown.
The Ayatollah seized power
and the nation was declared
an Islamic republic.
This Iranian revolution
shaped the Middle East
for decades after,
and the fallout has haunted
the US foreign policy
ever since.
Indeed, one can draw
a straight line from 1979
to Trump's decision
to bomb Iran's
nuclear facilities last month.
The author and veteran
war correspondent
Scott Anderson
has a fascinating new book,
Revisiting the Revolution
and America's Error's.
Before and After.
It is called King of Kings.
Scott, welcome.
Thank you. For you.
So one of the things
that I think
we always puzzle about
when looking at Iran today is
how Islamic is the regime
and how Islamic is the country.
In other words,
how stable is this
Islamic revolution?
Can you overturn it
because you point
out, fascinatingly,
that it didn't start out
actually as very Islamic.
There was a bunch of
leftists and socialists.
So how do you answer
that question,
given the history, you know?
I think the real key
to understanding both
the Iranian revolution of
79 and of Iran today is that
along with the religious
revival within Iran,
there was also a movement
of anti-colonialism.
The Shah was seen
as a servant
of the United States.
and what
how do you see that
playing out today,
40 some odd years into the,
into the Islamic revolution?
Is that again,
that the
idea of us
versus them that you see in
Iran is fortifying the regime?
And certainly
so when we bomb the regime,
it benefits from a kind of,
you know, the support
of the mass.
That's that's right.
And I, I maintain a discreet,
communication
with the number of people
in Iran.
And what I've been hearing
since the bombings is
there's most of
in the opposition.
They they're despondent.
They they see their movement
put back years and years
because of this.
There's been a tremendous
rallying around the flag effect
within Iran.
and now the regime can tarnish
their opposition
as lackeys of the Americans
and the Israelis.
So it plays perfectly
into their hands.
So what you're painting is, is
the picture of is a regime
that is not
teetering on
the brink of collapse.
I don't believe so.
I don't believe it is at all.
I think that
what I've
some of my Iranian contacts
have brought this up.
When Benjamin
Netanyahu said
during the bombings,
the Israeli bombing
said this is about
regime change. I mean, what a
what a self-defeating thing
to have said,
because that, again,
it was just rallying
cause the country
to rally around the regime.
You, you, you in your book,
you address this so.
Well,
the central question
historically about our,
the United States,
the support for the Shah was
were we to tough
or were we to too soft
because, you know, Carter was,
in a weird way,
blamed for both.
He comes into office
this big avatar
of human rights.
but then, so people
thought he was going
to be super
critical of the Shah.
Then he says,
you are an island of stability.
And a turbulent region.
But then when the riots,
people feel like
he should have supported
the Shah,
you know, more forcefully.
What lesson do,
first of all,
tell us what you think
happened in that history
and what lesson do you draw?
There are so many ironies
with the Iranian
revolution, one being that,
of course, the CIA helped
prop the Shah back into power
in 1953,
a detailed
most Americans
certainly did not know,
but every Iranian knew about.
And since 1950.
Three, planned, by the way,
the plotting of the return
of the Shah in 53,
54 took place
in the basement
of the American embassy. Right.
Which is why they went in
that strike.
and so he was always seen
as the American Shah.
And that's why I really feel
with the Iranian revolution.
Of course,
you had this,
this religious current,
but you also had this
element of anti-colonialism
that the Shah was seen
as a lack of the Americans.
And I think people certainly
in the Carter
administration were very slow
to, to see that,
as the Shah was.
So the remarkable
thing about the Shah,
when people are marching
in the streets
against his rule,
he was calling
Carter and saying,
please come out
publicly and say, I'm your man.
Essentially the worst
possible thing
that could have been done.
And he did it again and again
for a very smart man.
He really made some dumb moves.
When you look at rerun,
you know, looking forward,
do you think that,
they're likely to kind of cry
uncle in a way that,
you know, people are expecting?
I don't know.
you know, one thing
I feel about Iran,
and this really goes back to
the Iranian revolution, is that
this was the start of, of
of this religious nationalism
that you now see
in every faith,
Christian nationalism
in this country.
you know, Buddhist
nationalism in Sri Lanka.
ultra-Orthodox in Israel.
Yeah. Over and over again.
So this seems to be a,
a movement, a fever that that
certain regimes can,
can galvanize the masses with.
And I think that if,
if the
Iranian regime is clever,
it will make this, this attack
from the Israelis
and the Americans
into kind of a
religious attack,
that it's not just Iran,
it's Islam being attacked.
And if they are
able to do that,
I think that probably
it's going
to give them a new lease on
life for a number of years.
Scott, pleasure to have you on.
Thank you.
Thank you for a terrific book.
Thank you.
